# SpaceGoons

Hello and welcome to Space Goons. This is a quick game designed to test the ability to balance risk and reward. It is a text-based game where you will navigate the Galaxy in an attempt to reach home. You will be presented with a number of options, and you must use your resources and time wisely. Running out of resources, or running out of time, will leave you defeated. Have fun!

This was developed on node version 12 and not tested on any other version. To begin, type `node start.js`.
